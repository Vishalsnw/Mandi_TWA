  <h1>Privacy Policy for Mandi Mitra</h1>

  <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>25 Nov 2025</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Mandi Mitra</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides market price updates, mandi information, and related services through our Android application.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We prioritize user privacy. The app does <strong>not</strong> require user registration and we do not collect personal data unless explicitly required for a feature and with your consent.</p>

  <h3>1. Device Info (Non-Personal)</h3>
  <p>We may collect non-personal technical information such as device model, OS version, and basic anonymous usage metrics to help improve app stability and features. This data cannot be used to personally identify you.</p>

  <h3>2. Internet Access</h3>
  <p>The app connects to the internet to fetch mandi prices and market updates. Network requests are made to retrieve public market data.</p>

  <h3>3. No Sensitive Data</h3>
  <p>We do NOT collect or store the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Address</li>
    <li>Aadhaar / PAN or other government IDs</li>
    <li>Financial account details</li>
    <li>Precise device location (we do not store GPS coordinates)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app may use or integrate with third-party services for analytics, crash reporting, or ads. Examples (if enabled) include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services</li>
    <li>Firebase Analytics (optional)</li>
    <li>AdMob (only if ads are enabled)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Third-party providers have their own privacy practices — enabling those services may share limited, non-personal data with them. We recommend reviewing those providers' policies.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We do not store personal user data on our servers. Any collected market data is fetched from trusted sources and handled securely via HTTPS. We strive to follow reasonable security practices, but no app is completely immune to risks.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect data from children under the applicable age. If you believe we have inadvertently collected data from a child, contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected on this page with the updated "Last updated" date.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
